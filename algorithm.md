# average-of-numbers
Sure, here's the algorithm for the given code:

1. Start the program.
2. Declare variables n3, arr, i, sum and avg.
3. In the main function, ask the user to input the number of elements to calculate the average of.
4. Call the function average(n3) to calculate the average of n3 elements.
5. In the function average(int n3), create an array arr of size n3 to store the input numbers.
6. Ask the user to input n3 numbers and store them in the array arr using a for loop.
7. Calculate the sum of the numbers using a for loop and add them to the variable sum.
8. Calculate the average of the numbers by dividing the sum by n3 and store it in the variable avg.
9. Display the average value to the user using printf().
10. End the program.
